EDM aims at changing the shape, size, roughness and surface properties of a workpiece when exposed to electric charges resulted in electric erosion, thus expanding production capacity. The list of our equipment operating on EDM principle includes:

*	Wire-cutting machines which allow us to machine complex-shaped contour in the areas inaccessible for a cutting tool, combined with high frequency;
*	Punching machines for closed slots with minimal radii at all contact points.
