There is always a lot of concern about tools and other products safety during transportation and storing. No doubt, it is relatively easy to find a foreign-made package at the current highly competitive market. However, there are a number of purchase limitations — minimum order quantity, delivery time etc.

We can guarantee:

*	fast off-the-shelf delivery of any amount (up to 10 psc) for rotary cutting tools;
*	high-quality package 2-3 times cheaper than the corresponding foreign-made package;
*	color selection option, provided the order quantity is met.

On top of that we are ready to deliver package for cutting turning plates, cases and other items.

The list of available typical sizes can be downloaded here. The available color is blue.

We are happy to offer you only what we successfully use ourselves.
