Laser engraving is an automated process. Application parameters are set using the special software and a piece gets fixed in the laser machine. During the engraving process a laser beam vaporizes some layer of the material burning it down to the preset depth and width, that’s why the engraving is resistant to any external factors. It can’t be removed or washed away. Oftentimes, laser engraving can be the only way to personalize an item.

Laser engraving can be widely applied: in promotional goods, prizes, presents, business souvenirs, office equipment and many more. Besides, laser engraving can be used in different areas to engrave a company logo, serial numbers, barcodes, consecutive page numbering etc.
