We provide high-quality wear-resistant and protective thin-film high-adhesive coating at Platit Pi80.

The examples of items that can be coated are the following:

*	carbide drills, mills and countersinks;
*	taps and high-speed cutting tools;
*	gear-cutting tools (mortising cutters, worm milling cutters);
*	thread rolls and mill rolls;
*	dies, punches and blank dies.

Our expertise in production of our own carbide cutting tools combined with our Customers’ feedback makes a significant difference in application of advanced wear-resistant coatings. In some cases such coating operations can be voted as the only possible way to reach required technological performance parameters and reliability. Nowadays over 90% of carbide cutting tools and over 70% of high-speed cutting tools get coated whereas for gear-cutting tools coating is a 100% must.

It also must be noticed here that workpieces have to meet specific requirements: they must be clean, with no traces of oil, paint or adhesive tape as well as securely packed to avoid damage during transportation. Workpieces must be demagnetized and contain no anticorrosion, galvanic or protective coating. Flutes and grooves must contain no oxide residues or heat-treatment agents.

It should be emphasized here that our tools always demonstrate excellent performance and long tool life. We apply nACo-G coating (Platit’s signature formula).
