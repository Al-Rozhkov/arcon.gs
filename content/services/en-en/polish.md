description: 'The most important step in the production of cutting tools is the finishing of their surfaces. The blunting of the cutting edges has a direct influence on their durability and wear character, and the roughness value of the surfaces is reflected in the chip drain.'

Polishing of tool surfaces is considered to be the crucial step of production process. Blunt cutting edges can directly affect tool life and wear patterns whereas surface roughness can impact on chip drain.

We improve the quality of our tool by finishing it out in the flow-type tumbling machines with the use of special abrasive solution and our own technological process PurePolish™.

The achieved damping of the cutting edge (parameters depend on a tool’s purpose and material grade) can arguably make your tool life 3 times longer.

Due to significant formlining smoothing and decrease in roughness a contact pattern of the cutting edges with the work material expands, thus decreasing the unit loading. That is the crucial factor in the tool durability.

It also should be pointed out that high-quality polishing is essential for both coated and uncoated tools. The reason lies in the decrease in surface friction which in its turn enables effective chip drain. It is widely recognized that thin-film coating (TiN, AlTiN, nACo-G etc.) improves the tool surface roughness. But the experience has shown that this opinion is erroneous due to the coating process peculiarities. A coated tool requires polishing both before and after coating, the latter providing removal of dripping phase and possible craters.

The effectiveness of PurePolish™ technology has been proven by the comprehensive positive feedback from our Customers in regards to the use of ARCONIT tools in various machining operations and producing high-quality products. You are also welcome to evaluate our quality!
