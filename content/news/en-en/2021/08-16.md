Our needs for replenishment of the finished tool stock (which we told you about earlier [here](/news/2020/carbide-drills-from-stock/) and [here](/news/2020/stock-replenishment/)) are increasing and require solutions for the optimization of production processes.

We are glad to inform you, that the CVM Arcon Ltd (manufacturer of cutting tools ARCONIT) already today produces technical re-equipment and retrofitting in order to increase automation of cutting tools production, which will lead to the increase of represented nomenclature in stock according to the "same day dispatch" system and already today it allows to restrain the price increase of the finished products.

Automation affected:

* billet change systems;
* tool loading/unloading systems;
* balancing systems for grinding mandrels.

In addition, we are constantly carrying out activities to improve the quality of finished products.
