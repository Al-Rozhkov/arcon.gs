Together with [Eugen Fahrion GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.fahrion.de/), a world leader in the field of high-precision machine tooling, we implemented a project to equip our production with GERC-HP series chucks and collets with individual runout to 0,002 mm. 

As a result we became almost the only tool-making enterprise in Russia which can offer you service of manufacturing and restoration of tools with shank from ⌀1,5 mm up to ⌀20 mm with pitch 0,01 mm, for example - to re-turn tool ⌀13,1 mm.

We understand that such a service is not trivial and will rarely be in demand.

At the same time our main task is to solve the customer's problems and to take a comprehensive approach to the work. We believe that investment in equipment and tooling (especially in the current situation of the industry) will allow us once again to improve the quality of our services and expand the range of solutions we offer you.
