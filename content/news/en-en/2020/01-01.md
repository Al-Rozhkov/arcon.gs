We are pleased to inform you that since the beginning of 2020, ARCONIT tools for machining non-ferrous materials are only available with a polished groove. This allows:

* Increase the life of the cutting tool;
* Reduce the coefficient of friction and therefore improve chip drainage;
* Improve the roughness of the surface of the workpiece.

It is worth noting that it did not have any effect on the price of our tool. With comparable quality ARCONIT prices are always lower. 

For more information, see ["Services"](/services/).
